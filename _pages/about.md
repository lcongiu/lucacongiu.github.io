Bio
======
My research is in Behavioral and Experimental Economics, Behavioral Public Policy, and Economic Psychology. I apply insights from the social and behavioral sciences to investigate people's behavior and suggest policies to steer it in virtuous directions. My latest strand of research focuses on investigating how one's (economic) behavior is affected by image concerns and personality traits. I mainly conduct lab and online experiments, and I program them with oTree.
