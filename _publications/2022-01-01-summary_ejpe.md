Congiu, Luca.

[comment]: <excerpt: 'This thesis introduces a novel framework for analyzing and designing choice architectures by distinguishing between two key dimensions: Message (verbal and informational cues) and Environment (physical or digital context). Through theoretical analysis and experimental studies, it shows how these dimensions interact to influence decision-making, offering insights for more effective behavioral interventions and public policies.'>
